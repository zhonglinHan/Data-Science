#This function extracts statistics for each session in an enrollment, such as average session duration, standard deviation
# of session duration, and min and max session duration. All in unit hours.
# Inputs: data is an array with 5 columns,  
# Col1: year, 
# Col2: week number, 
# Col3: session id when new session starts if two events are apart for more than 3 hours, 
# Col4: session id when new session starts if two events are apart for more than 1 hour, 
# Col5: time stamp of the event
# Note: session id starts from 1
# The second input is the column index of the session id. When calculating the statistics of 3-hour defined sessions, 
# sessionid_index= 2, when calculating the statistics of 1-hour defined sessions, sessionid_index=3,
# Outputs: session_stat, a list of 4 float values, in the unit of hours. 
# Value1: average duration of sessions
# Value2: if session number>1, standard deviation of session duration. Otherwise, 0
# Value3: maximal session duration
# Value4: minimal session duration
